#BASICS OF ANGULAR

1.  Every component can be designed in a seperate folder with the .ts, .html, .css file.
    Each component should be taken as a class that we decorate (using the @Component keyword) 
    that can be later exported to be used in different components. (Using child component for   
    inside the parent component.)

2.  To use for eg. 'SelectedUser', we needed to export this within the class in the .ts file 
    and this can be later used for eg. in the .html file of that component or some other component. 
    All of this can also be used in the end in the app.component.ts file! 

#STRING INTERPOLATION & PROPERTY BINDING

1.  String INTERPOLATION and Property Binding used for outputting Dynamic Data content in Angular. 
2.  Do not forget '/assets/users/', the last slash to complete the image path. 
3.  For example, <img [src]="someSrc"> binds the src property of the underlying HTMLImageElement 
    DOM object to the value stored in someSrc.

4.  One can also use 'getters' in the class itself for dynamic property binding with the 'this.' keyword.
